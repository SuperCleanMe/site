# Our Goals.
Kalavar is a large, and admittedly ambitious project, which aims to provide many things that may or may not end up happening in the final product. Some of those things are listed below:

- [X] Asynchronous
- [X] Stable
- [X] Efficient
- [X] Powerful
- [X] Easy to use
- [X] Easy to learn
- [X] Easy to migrate to
- [X] Easy to manage
- [X] Easy to backup
- [X] Easy to configure

This list is obviously quite the large list of things to manage to bring to a custom built database product, so we wont be disappointed if we cant find a way to encompass them all in the end product, but we are going to do our best to ensure we succeed in our goal, and we hope you enjoy following our progress via the [developer logs](/dev-logs/).
