# Strings
Strings are grouped arrays of singular characters, they have no upper maximum length and are always encoded using UTF-8.

### How do i use a `string` value?
Strings are formatted by wrapping string content within the `"` (double quote) character in your queries. This signifies a string, and any newlines or query content within the string is ignored.

### Information
- Max Length: infinite\*
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Category: Text

### Errors
N/A

*A string may be infinite length, but the true length of the string is dependant on the limitations of the hardware the system is running on
